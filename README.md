## Improvements

If I could spend a bit more time on the solution, I would add the following:

- Field edge detection / validation
- Abstract the Console commands out of the orchestrator (to allow unit testing of the game loop) 
- Implement mines only exploding the first time they're stepped on
- Input key validation
